ros-jade-teb-local-planner (0.3.1-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Fixed wrong coordinate transformation in 'line' and 'polygon' footprint models.
  * Trajectory selection strategy in case of multiple topologies updated:
    * The obstacle costs for selection can now be scaling separately.
    * The cost regarding time optimality can now be replaced by the actual transition time.
    * Added a hysteresis to cost comparison between a new and the previously selected trajectory.
    * In the default parameter setting the strategy is similar to release 0.3.0.
  * Warning message removed that occured if an odom message with only zeros was received.

ros-jade-teb-local-planner (0.3.0-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Different/custom robot footprints are now supported and subject to optimization (refer to the new tutorial!).
  * The new robot footprint is also visualized using the common marker topic.
  * The strategy of taking occupied costmap cells behind the robot into account has been improved.
    These changes significantly improve navigation close to walls.
  * Parameter 'max_global_plan_lookahead_dist' added.
    Previously, the complete subset of the global plan contained in the local costmap
    was taken into account for choosing the current intermediate goal point. With this parameter, the maximum
    length of the reference global plan can be limited. The actual global plan subset
    is now computed using the logical conjunction of both local costmap size and 'max_global_plan_lookahead_dist'.
  * Bug fixes:
    * Fixed a compilation issue on ARM architectures
    * If custom obstacles are used, the container with old obstacles is now cleared properly.
  * Parameter cleanup:
    * "weight_X_obstacle" parameters combined to single parameter "weight_obstacle".
    * "X_obstacle_poses_affected" parameters combined to single parameter "obstacle_poses_affected".
    * Deprecated parameter 'costmap_emergency_stop_dist' removed.
  * Code cleanup

ros-jade-teb-local-planner (0.2.3-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Marker lifetime changed
  * In case the local planner detects an infeasible trajectory it does now try to
    reduce the horizon to 50 percent of the length. The trajectory is only reduced
    if some predefined cases are detected.
    This mechanism constitutes a backup behavior.
  * Improved carlike robot support.
    Instead of commanding the robot using translational and rotational velocities,
    the robot might also be commanded using the transl. velocity and steering angle.
    Appropriate parameters are added to the config.
  * Changed default parameter for 'h_signature_threshold' from 0.01 to 0.1 to better match the actual precision.
  * Some python scripts for data conversion added
  * Minor other changes

ros-jade-teb-local-planner (0.2.2-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Carlike robots (ackermann steering) are supported from now on (at least experimentally)
    by specifying a minimum bound on the turning radius.
    Currently, the output of the planner in carlike mode is still (v,omega).
    Since I don't have any real carlike robot, I would be really happy if someone could provide me with
    some feedback to further improve/extend the support.
  * Obstacle cost function modified to avoid undesired jerks in the trajectory.
  * Added a feedback message that contains current trajectory information (poses, velocities and temporal information).
    This is useful for analyzing and debugging the velocity profile e.g. at runtime.
    The message will be published only if it's activated (rosparam).
    A small python script is added to plot the velocity profile (while *test_optim_node* runs).
  * Cost functions are now taking the direction/sign of the translational velocity into account:
    Specifying a maximum backwards velocity other than forward velocity works now.
    Additionally, the change in acceleration is now computed correctly if the robot switches directions.
  * The global plan is now pruned such that already passed posses are cut off
    (relevant for global planners with *planning_rate=0*).
  * Fixed issue#1: If a global planner with *planning_rate=0* was used,
    a TF timing/extrapolation issue appeared after some time.
  * The planner resets now properly if the velocity command cannot be computed due to invalid optimization results.

ros-jade-teb-local-planner (0.2.1-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * This is an important bugfix release.
  * Fixed a major issue concerning the stability and performance of the optimization process. Each time the global planner was updating the global plan, the local planner was resetted completely even if
    the updated global plan did not differ from the previous one. This led to stupid reinitializations and a slighly jerky behavior if the update rate of the global planner was high (each 0.5-2s).
    From now on the local planner is able to utilize the global plan as a warm start and determine automatically whether to reinitialize or not.
  * Support for polygon obstacles extended and improved (e.g. the homotopy class planner does now compute actual distances to the polygon rather than utilizing the distance to the centroid).

ros-jade-teb-local-planner (0.2.0-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * The teb_local_planner supports costmap_converter plugins (pluginlib) from now on. Those plugins convert occupied costmap2d cells into polygon shapes.
    The costmap_converter is disabled by default, since the extension still needs to be tested (parameter choices, computation time advantages, etc.).
    A tutorial will explain how to activate the converter using the ros-param server.
