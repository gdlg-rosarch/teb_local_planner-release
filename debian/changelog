ros-jade-teb-local-planner (0.2.2-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Carlike robots (ackermann steering) are supported from now on (at least experimentally)
    by specifying a minimum bound on the turning radius.
    Currently, the output of the planner in carlike mode is still (v,omega).
    Since I don't have any real carlike robot, I would be really happy if someone could provide me with
    some feedback to further improve/extend the support.
  * Obstacle cost function modified to avoid undesired jerks in the trajectory.
  * Added a feedback message that contains current trajectory information (poses, velocities and temporal information).
    This is useful for analyzing and debugging the velocity profile e.g. at runtime.
    The message will be published only if it's activated (rosparam).
    A small python script is added to plot the velocity profile (while *test_optim_node* runs).
  * Cost functions are now taking the direction/sign of the translational velocity into account:
    Specifying a maximum backwards velocity other than forward velocity works now.
    Additionally, the change in acceleration is now computed correctly if the robot switches directions.
  * The global plan is now pruned such that already passed posses are cut off
    (relevant for global planners with *planning_rate=0*).
  * Fixed issue#1: If a global planner with *planning_rate=0* was used,
    a TF timing/extrapolation issue appeared after some time.
  * The planner resets now properly if the velocity command cannot be computed due to invalid optimization results.

ros-jade-teb-local-planner (0.2.1-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * This is an important bugfix release.
  * Fixed a major issue concerning the stability and performance of the optimization process. Each time the global planner was updating the global plan, the local planner was resetted completely even if
    the updated global plan did not differ from the previous one. This led to stupid reinitializations and a slighly jerky behavior if the update rate of the global planner was high (each 0.5-2s).
    From now on the local planner is able to utilize the global plan as a warm start and determine automatically whether to reinitialize or not.
  * Support for polygon obstacles extended and improved (e.g. the homotopy class planner does now compute actual distances to the polygon rather than utilizing the distance to the centroid).

ros-jade-teb-local-planner (0.2.0-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * The teb_local_planner supports costmap_converter plugins (pluginlib) from now on. Those plugins convert occupied costmap2d cells into polygon shapes.
    The costmap_converter is disabled by default, since the extension still needs to be tested (parameter choices, computation time advantages, etc.).
    A tutorial will explain how to activate the converter using the ros-param server.

ros-jade-teb-local-planner (0.1.7-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Finally fixed saucy compilation issue by retaining compatiblity to newer distros
    (my "new" 13.10 VM helps me to stop spamming new releases for testing).

ros-jade-teb-local-planner (0.1.6-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Fixed compilation errors on ubuntu saucy caused by different FindEigen.cmake scripts.
    I am not able to test releasing on saucy, forcing me to release again and again. Sorry.

ros-jade-teb-local-planner (0.1.5-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Added possibility to dynamically change parameters of test_optim_node using dynamic reconfigure.
  * Fixed a wrong default-min-max tuple in the dynamic reconfigure config.
  * Useful config and launch files are now added to cmake install.
  * Added install target for the test_optim_node executable.
